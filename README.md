# opencv_cropping

v. 0.0.1

The Preservation department at the University of Chicago Library produces high
resolution images of pages from manuscripts and other items from the Library
Archives. Many of these images are captured with a ruler and color bar along
one edge. 

This script automatically detects and removes that ruler using the computer
vision library OpenCV.
